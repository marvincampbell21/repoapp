# Getting Started with Create React App

This application was createed along with one other developer. Our team work together was create and we got to use more advanced libraires and languages to complete our project.

React js and Redux were great tools that we were able to implemet for this project. The idea was to be able to see anyones github directory by searching there username through our application. 

We believe that this can be of use for many different reasons. Maybe for professors who want to easily see what new projects their students are working on. This can be for students who want to see their classmates githubs. And for any developer who want to see anyones github repository. 

Overall this application was a pleasure to development and test my partner and I in several ways.
